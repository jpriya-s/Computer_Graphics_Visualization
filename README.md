Designing the 3D game scene is exciting and complex. My approach is to decode the 2D scene, identify all the unique objects, and then design each object with one or more 3D shapes. Once the objects are designed, I design other factors like the color or texture of the objects, the number of lights and their positions, the initial camera angle, and the movement patterns. 

Individual simple methods help define the scope clearly and will help with maintenance and understanding. Iteration will help create the same objects multiple times by passing dynamic values in the arguments. Each milestone focuses on tasks, like creating objects, applying color/design, setting the camera, and setting the lights, which is helping me focus on specific features and learn and try more on the same topic.

Computer Science helps me understand how to approach solving a problem, such as first understanding the requirements clearly, designing, coding, testing, and finally deploying. Graphics languages are different from programming languages because graphics have an exact look and feel, and achieving the required functionality takes longer compared to developing code using programming languages.
